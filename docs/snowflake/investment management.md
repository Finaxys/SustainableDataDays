**Asset Managers** (AM) place the money entrusted by investors to them in **assets** to seek future growth.

With **responsible investment** (RI) or **sustainable finance** (SF), the same investors are also looking to extra financial criteria (ESG) to reach the same level of performance or at least give some additional purpose for their **investment vehicle**.

RI must not be confused with **impact investing** that targets investment in projects and companies that aims to make a true positive contribution across a range of environmental and social issues.

Investors have to declare the objectives of their **funds** from the beginning and the rules they will follow when they will perform **investment decisions**. 

The most common ones are :
- Sectorial exclusion policy (ex: tobacco, thermal coal, controversial weapon)
- Investment in specific sector, industry or geographic areas
- Short / Medium / Long term financial performance
- Exclusion of the worst 20% peformer on ESG KPI
- Select only the Best-in-Class issuers (ie. Companies)
- Ensure a minimum ratio of sustainable investments in the portfolio

Financial performance of a fund is generally compared with a **"benchmark"** (ex: NASDAQ, CAC40, S&P 500, EUROSTOXX 600). 

There is two categories of asset managers: **active** and **passive**:
- With active fund management, a fund manager is "mandated" to make the "investment decisions" based the rules he has been given for the fund.
- In passive fund management, the investment is made automatically by tracking the composition of an **"index"** provided by a specialized data provider.

The index is constructed with same principles as above. Examples of ESG indices are 'MSCI USA Extended ESG Focus Index' or 'S&P 500 ESG Index'.

Keep calm, we don't aim to model all this complexity during the workshop.

Here, each investor will follow a very simple **"strategy"**.

A strategy is composed of a list of **"issuings"** identified by an **"ISIN"** code.

We have created several investment strategies that market participants identified as "investors" will follow.
Some strategies we will use:
- TOP_20_FR_G
- TECHNOLOGY
- BEST_OF_CLASS_ESG
- ALL_FR_BIG_MARKET_CAP
